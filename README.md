DeepLIFT: Deep Learning Important FeaTures
===
An algorithm for computing importance scores of deep neural networks. [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.01713)

##Installation

DeepLIFT depends on theano (>= 0.8) and numpy (>= 1.9). It can also autoconvert keras models trained with keras 0.3. Support for keras 1.0 is in the works (on [this branch](https://github.com/kundajelab/deeplift/tree/keras_1_compatibility) started by @jisungk)
